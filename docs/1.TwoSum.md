# Intuition
According to the problem statement, there is exactly one solution. Let’s denote the solution as $[S_1, S_2]$, where $S_1 < S_2$. Consider an arbitrary element at index $i$. How can we determine if this element is part of the solution? 

We need to verify the following conditions are met:

<div align="center">

1.$i = S_2$  
2.$\exists j \in [0, i - 1]: j = S_1$

</div>

We cannot check this directly because $S_1$ and $S_2$ are unknown. However, we can rephrase the condition using the problem's constraints:

<div align="center">

$nums[j] + nums[i] = target$

</div>

The challenge is efficiently checking all possible values of $j$. A brute-force approach would yield $O(n^2)$ time complexity. To optimize, we rewrite the condition as:

<div align="center">

$1.complemet = nums[i] - target$
$2.nums[j] = complement$

</div>

The main idea is to introduce a data structure $D$ to store values and their indices as we iterate. Since there is exactly one solution, we only need to store the most recent index for each value. The algorithm works as follows:
```
IF complement EXISTS IN D:
    RETURN [i, D[complement]]
ELSE:
    STORE nums[i] in D with index i
```
The essential requirement is that checking for the complement in $D$ must be efficient. Ideally it should take $O(1)$ time. As you migh have guessed a [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) satisfies this requirement, leading to the final algorithm.
```
hashmap = EMPTY_HASH_TABLE
FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(nums) - 1:
    num_i = nums[i]
    complement = target - num_i    
    IF complement EXISTS IN hashmap:
        RETURN [i, hashmap[complement]]
    hashmap[num_i] = i
END FOR
```

# Approach
[Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in hashmap:
                return [i, hashmap[complement]]
            hashmap[num] = i
```
